If there aren't blue corn tortillas then
3 cheese
rolled
flour
red chile

# Ranking

  1. Cervantes (Never misses. Their chile is hot but still doesn't give me heartburn. Their rice is amazing. Its not just an afterthought. Insane vibes -- swords and fireplaces and always decked out for the holidays.)
  2. Duran's station (Amazing food and easy second to the excellent Cervantes, but rice is not part of the combo. Excellent vibes -- feels like coming home.)
  3. Papa Felipe's (Enjoyable. Doesn't knock your socks off, but its great. Both rolled and blue stacked are good. Great salsa.) 
  4. Los Cuates (I normally really like this place, but the stacked didn't have the cheese melted all the way through. The rolled are great. Red chile is good).

# Unranked (coming soon):

  1. El Patio (probably second favorite spot)
  2. Frontier (lol)
  3. El Mariachi (never been)
